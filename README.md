# EA Agentic Lab Stories

Interactive stories that show how AI agents solve real pain points in enterprise sales engineering. Each story starts with a familiar problem, walks through the cost of the status quo, and reveals how agentic AI changes the outcome.

These aren't feature demos. They're experiences designed to make you feel the problem before you see the solution.

## Stories

**The Onboarding Trap** - Your new SA won't be useful for 90 days. Here's what that costs.

**The Tribal Knowledge Trap** - "Ask John, he knows." John is on vacation.

**The Self-Learning System** - Your CRM learned nothing from 200 deals. What if it did? Explores how AI agents capture meeting knowledge, learn from deal outcomes, and improve recommendations over time.

**The Interface Gap** - You wrote perfect documentation. Half your team will never read it. Features an interactive "Choose Your Player" system where readers experience the story through their own cognitive style: Reader, Talker, Visual, or Doer.

## Coming Soon

- **The Question Tax** - Your senior SA answered "Where is the pricing doc?" 23 times this month.
- **Starting from Zero** - 247 deals closed. Every new one still starts with a blank page.
- **The Handoff Gap** - Sales closed the deal. Nobody told the CA what was promised.
